Ultra optimal forward error correction design for performance, power, area, reliability and flexibility. This code family would demostrate correction performance,
which include
1. WSH code family for codeword info = 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192. These codes are proposed for B5G/6G channel coding   
2. 5G NR NTU code proposed family (My name is inside the attachment):

It is noticeable that the result of 1,2 is shown in soft-input correction

Here provide some figure property
a. raw bit error rate vs. frame error rate
b. signal noise ratio vs frame error rate, containing energy-bit signal and energy-symbol signal
c. exact error bit vs eaxct frame error rate, which means bit-err is directly compared with BCH correction
d. exact error bit vs throughput: demo hard-input throughput
