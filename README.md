Ultra optimal forward error correction design for performance, power, area, reliability and flexibility. This code family would demostrate correction performance,
which include
1. WSH code family for codeword info = 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192. These codes are proposed for B5G/6G channel coding   
2. 5G NR NTU code proposed family (My name is inside the attachment):
