Here provides comparison material to implement the optimal FEC in B5G/6G system

X-axis is noticed that Es/N0 is direct linked to raw bit error rate (channel condition)
Eb/N0 is for fair comparison among the same info length with different parity size

Y-axis also must be noticed more if next-gen communication. 10^3 CWs(or frames) means around 100KB - 1MB transmission testing.
10^6 CWs(or frames) means around 100MB - 1GB transmission testing.
10^8 or more CWs(or frames) will reach over-100GB-data reliable and high-quality communication to match every use case.

The parameter of code rate is suitable for turbo code, convolution code but not for ldpc code.
LDPC design focuses on parity length (number of check node), qc-size(number of parallel processing), codeword length (time cost)
